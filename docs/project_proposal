A Machine Learning Model to Predict Flow Around a Pitching Airfoil 

Spencer Schwartz 

The aerodynamics of a static airfoil is largely understood from experiments, mathematical models, and simulations. In recent years, researchers have looked at how aerodynamics change when the airfoil is moving, like pitching or plunging. This movement induces unsteady aerodynamics and is a growing field of interest. However, due to the turbulent nature of the flow, and the moving solid boundaries of the airfoil, experiments and simulations are slow and expensive. Researchers have begun to use machine learning (ML) to solve similar problems ​(Baldan & Guardone, 2024; J. Wang et al., 2021; X. Wang et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2022; Zhang, 2023)​ some for-pitching airfoils to predict dynamic stall. An interesting approach was taken in ​X. Wang et al., 2024​ where a combined autoencoder (CAE) was used to predict aerodynamic coefficients, like the drag and pressure distribution. A different approach was taken in ​Zhang, 2023​ which used a convolutional auto-encoder to predict the flow field around a static airfoil in unsteady flow. Both methods use reduced order modeling (ROM), mainly with an auto-encoder, which is advantageous for fluid mechanics problems because of the high dimensionality of many problems, especially turbulence. We propose to combine the two methods of ​(X. Wang et al., 2024; Zhang, 2023)​ and extend it to pitching airfoils. The network will be trained on simulation data obtained from Basilisk, a free open-source computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software. The goal of this project is to use this proposed hybrid method to accurately predict flow field characteristics (pressure field, vorticity field, etc.) and aerodynamic coefficients (lift, drag, pressure, etc.) for pitching airfoils given their Reynolds number, airfoil shape, and function to define the orientation. 

The scope of the project may risk extending the completion of the project past the deadline set by the class. To mitigate this, only one of the two result types, i.e. only predict flow field characteristics, will be looked at (as an extension of ​(Zhang, 2023)​) first before moving on to predicting aerodynamic coefficients.
